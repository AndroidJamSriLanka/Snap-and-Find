# Snap & Find - Address Finder

#### Problem:
Most of the time the addresses of where we wanna go is on paper. May be on a business card, newspaper or may be on a poster on a wall. If we wanna know where it is we need to enter the address manually and search. Its time consuming and boring.

#### Solution:
Use the camera of your smartphone to quicly snap a photo of the address and search the address on google maps. Find the location in just a snap. App uses OCR to extract the address from the photo and reverse geocoding to find and navigate the user to the destination.
